- We are now in 4th industrial Revolution
  - More productive use of resources
    - Air B&B
    - Car sharing
    - renewable energy
      - batteries, transmission, wind, solar economics
      - once we figure out how to share it in an efficient economy, ... 
      - block chain for energy and commodity trading
    - Gig Economy
      - use to be if a company needed a graphic artist, or an accountant, administrative assistant, designer, or a what ever
        - hire them
        - hire a firm that made resources available to the companies
      - now, gig it... use an accountant when you need an accountant... without firm overhead

    - Current State:
      - Consumer
        - home automation - mostly gimmicky
          - my mom got new fridge... txts her when door is left open too long. helps save a little energy here.  on consumer side, energy savings costs are less than investment to install sensors, monitors, software, etc.
      - Industrial Side
        - 600 platform providers on market
        - lots of cost... small wins
        - Big potential
    - Inevetiable future
      - Why now?
        - once it becomes cost effective.... save more money than spend, will really take off
          - and continue to drive that productivity/efficiency curve.
      - Convergence of technologies
        - able to aquire vast amounts of data (cost effectively)
        - Connectivity
          - 5G = ubiquitious , no cost connection
          - lots of bandwidth, not much cost
        - Low cost compute and storage
          - - low cost sensors, bandwidth, cloud computing, edge computing, low cost storage, ubiquitous connectivity 5G, neuromorphic computing...
        - Security / Privacy
          - security will be easy enough to use that people actually use it
        - Model and Predict
          - digital twins
        - Reason on data, and take action
          - artificial intelligence, streaming analytics,

            - handcrafted knowledge, statistical learning, contextual adaptation

        - management of complexity
          - Systems of Systems of Systems optimization
    - So what????
      - lots and lots and lots of data.  what to do with it?
        - What if you had information about the state of all the things around you and you can reason on that data?
          - IIoT Productivity examples
            - Driving Example
              - something we all understand
              - if we knew where all the traffic was and when the lights were to turn green
                - we could catch all the green lights, get there faster, and save fuel.
            - Manufacturing Example
              - optimize supply chain.
              - Less inventory. higher yield. better on-time delivery.  More efficient
            - Wind Turbines
            - Power Grid


    - Disruptions
      - many new business models
        - smart home, smart city, smart what ever.  
  
      - 3 Groups will emerge
        - Unawares
          - don't bother with industrial internet technologies.  Fade away as competition becomes more productive/efficient
        - Nice Trys
          - spend the money to collect data, but continue business as usual with out adapting to the reality the data show
          - if your business isn't using data to make decisions and adapt, your profitability will and existenace will fade away.

        - Long-Term Winners
          - discerningly invest to capture data
          - reason on data, react to data, adapt offerings and business model.  repeat
          - *Companies that quickly make decisions with data will win*

      - Real Disruption is Business Agility
        - roll new ideas to world immediately
        - Test market/business hypotheses in real time at low cost

      - lots of jobs for 
        - data connectivity, networking, security, AI, statistics, machine learning, cloud and edge development, DevOps

  
  - 3D Printing
    - what is subtractive?
    - what is additive?

      - [3D printed lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0rIP_u1JPQ)
      - what if you printed all the organs?
      - 
      - CRISPR
      - 
    - Digitally Create the Physical
    - Public report on current state of additive
    - Disruptions:
      - supply chain... print it where you need it... easier to send an email with the part than it is to send the part
        - This is especially helpful on missions to Mars... FedEx doesn't deliver there.
      - Old design practices don't apply
        - New Designs...old limitations don't exist.  Need to reinvent the education system
      - more complexity to manage
      - Once economics settle out, vast disruption in manufacturing "recycle"
        - totally disrupt tarrifs... do you tax the email of the design file?  will probably shift to taxing the raw materials. which will probably start wars to control the raw materials and powerder processing facilities.

# New Economic Model
    Economic- Keynesian, liberal… growth.  Now to maximize human well being
    New economic model
        Shift like… 20th century shifts. keynsiam ism … focus on health and education and gov working with business
        Reaction against this. (Near liberalism)  Free markets. Freedom individuals. Get governments out of the way
        New system.. meet basic needs of every human. Live within planetary means. Fairer.  Focus not on growth, but maximizing human well being 
            
    Value shift - trigged about new story about how we want to live
    Limitless growth (planet destroying) becoming less popular with Generation Y/Z

# Revolutions
##     Industry 1.0 
    refers to the first industrial revolution. It is marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to it is between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the US. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger middle class.[20] It also had an effect on British industry at the time.


##     Industry 2.0; 
    the second industrial revolution or better known as the technological revolution is the period between 1870 and 1914. It was made possible with the extensive railroad networks and the telegraph which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas. It is also marked by ever more present electricity which allowed for factory electrification and the modern production line. It is also a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity. It, however, caused a surge in unemployment since many workers were replaced by machines in factories.[21]

##     Industry 3.0
    The third industrial revolution or Industry 3.0 occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two big wars, as a result of a slowdown with the industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. It is also called digital revolution. The global crisis in 1929 was one of the negative economic developments which had an appearance in many industrialized countries from the first two revolutions. The production of Z1 (electrically driven mechanical calculator) was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. This continued with the next significant progress in the development of communication technologies with the supercomputer. In this process, where there was extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process. Machines started to abrogate the need for human power in life.[22]

## Fourth Industrial Revolution
    4th revolution.  Digital, Physical, Biological 

    Marriage of data, analytics, and real-time presentation
    Connectivity - network effect… instant
    From data to answers (Action)
         data/connectivity
            Hack the real world

       The fourth industrial revolution is the current  and developing environment in which disruptive technologies and trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the way we live and work.

    Industry 4.0 is the subset of the fourth industrial revolution[1] that concerns industry.
        Smart Manufacturing
        In essence, industry 4.0 describes the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber-physical systems (CPS), the internet of things (IoT), industrial internet of things (IIOT), cloud computing[2][3][4][5], cognitive computing and artificial intelligence.
