# DisruptWell Summit
A disruptive technology or innovation is one that goes on to create a new market and value network, disrupting the existing market. This innovation improves a product or service in ways the market does not expect. It’s a shift in how business is done.

Forward Thinking and Thought Provoking Presentations and Discussions on: Workforce Development, 5G, Blockchain, 3D Printing,  Humans & Technology, AI, Cybersecurity, Healthcare & more.

# Outline
- Intro
 - conference about disruptions
 - Look back to project forward.. establish context.

  - Our world has a constant drive for productivity
      - take what we've got and get more out of it. Improve our lives.  make things better. More efficient

# World GDP Growth
 - Zoom out.. look all the way back to year #1 and look at the world in aggregate
   - some ups and downs, but the net effect is overwhelming positive
   - Keep in mind, this chart shows growth rate.

# Global GDP per capita
 - if we look at at the actual number instead of the improvement rate, the shape of the curve shows a more obvious improvement.

 - On the average, the world is always improving.
   - keep in mind when you get depressed with all the negative press.  The reality is the world is becoming a better place every day when you look at the data on things like:
     - infant mortality rate
     - average life span
     - average GDP per capita
     - number of people in extreme poverty

    - enjoy a feel good moment and consider that over the last 60 years, the average quality of life for the average person on this planet has improved substantially!

 - but I digress... the point i am trying to make is that, while the world continues to get a little better, a litte more productive, a little more efficient every year, every so often, there are disruptions that rapidly increase the rate of improvement.
   - We call these revolutions and we are entering a big one now.


# Revolutions
## 4th Industrial Revolution
  - Describe 1-4
  - We are now in 4th industrial Revolution
  -      

- these are magor changes in the global productivity improvement rates.
- Let's zoom in a little and talk about productivity enhancements over the last few years. 
  - Let talk about more efficient use of resources.
# Gig Economy

## 150 Gig Economy Apps...
  yup, it's real now.
    - Gig Economy
      - use to be if a company needed a graphic artist, or an accountant, administrative assistant, designer, or a what ever
        - hire them
        - hire a firm that made resources available to the companies
      - now, gig it... use an accountant when you need an accountant... without firm overhead
      - need something, get something (Fiver, etc. etc. etc.)


# Internet of Things
## What is it?

## Why now?
  - Convergence of technologies
    - able to aquire vast amounts of data (cost effectively)
    - Connectivity
      - 5G = ubiquitious , no cost connection
      - lots of bandwidth, not much cost
    - Low cost compute and storage
      - low cost sensors, bandwidth, cloud computing, edge computing, low cost storage, ubiquitous connectivity 5G, neuromorphic computing...
    - Security / Privacy
      - security will be easy enough to use that people actually use it
    - Model and Predict

        - Systems of Systems of Systems optimization
       - 3rd Wave of AI 
          - handcrafted knowledge, statistical learning, contextual adaptation


## What's it worth
What can we do with these technologies?
  - What if you had information about the state of all the things around you and you can reason on that data?
    - IIoT Productivity examples
      - Commuting Example
        - something we all understand
        - if we knew where all the traffic was and when the lights were to turn green
          - we could catch all the green lights, get there faster, and save fuel.
      - Manufacturing Example
        - optimize supply chain.
        - Less inventory. higher yield. better on-time delivery.  More efficient
      - Wind Turbines

  - Technology dissappears
    - My son will never know a time when there wasn’t a smart speaker he could talk to 
    - I grew up when cell phones and connectivity were just starting and the SMCHS library got its 1st dial up modem. Now, multiple different connections to internet


  - Current State:
    - Consumer
      - home automation - mostly gimmicky
        - my mom got new fridge... txts her when door is left open too long. helps save a little energy here.  on consumer side, energy savings costs are less than investment to install sensors, monitors, software, etc.
    - Industrial Side
      - 600 platform providers on market
      - lots of cost... small wins
      - Big potential

  - Consumers buying gimmicks, but novelty is wearing off
  - Many companies investing... but not realizing returns
    - but some are

## IoT Disruptions
    - Disruptions
      - many new business models
        - smart home, smart city, smart what ever.  
  
### 3 Groups will emerge
  - Unawares
    - don't bother with industrial internet technologies.  Fade away as competition becomes more productive/efficient
  - Nice Trys
    - spend the money to collect data, but continue business as usual with out adapting to the reality the data show
    - if your business isn't using data to make decisions and adapt, your profitability will and existenace will fade away.

  - Long-Term Winners
    - discerningly invest to capture data
    - reason on data, react to data, adapt offerings and business model.  repeat
    - *Companies that quickly make decisions with data will win*

- Real Disruption of the Internet of Things:
  - is Business Agility
        - shift in how business is done
        - roll new ideas to world immediately
        - Test market/business hypotheses in real time at low cost
        - focus resources on what matters
        - adapt business as market changes
        - 

      - lots of jobs for 
        - data connectivity, networking, security, AI, statistics, machine learning, cloud and edge development, DevOps

## Disruptions:
  - Distributed manufacturing will democratize technology
  - Manufacturing Uber model
  - INternal manufacturing supply chain
  - tarrifs
  - Data driven commodity based artificial intelligence will increase human productivity and efficiency making the U.S. manufacturing base resilient

      - supply chain... print it where you need it... easier to send an email with the part than it is to send the part
        - This is especially helpful on missions to Mars... FedEx doesn't deliver there.
      - Old design practices don't apply
        - New Designs...old limitations don't exist.  Need to reinvent the education system
      - more complexity to manage
      - Once economics settle out, vast disruption in manufacturing "recycle"
        - totally disrupt tarrifs... do you tax the email of the design file?  will probably shift to taxing the raw materials. which will probably start wars to control the raw materials and powerder processing facilities.
      - Uber of manufacturing – savior of the middle class
      - The United States of America
        - Enabling innovation

# Revolutions
##     Industry 1.0 
    refers to the first industrial revolution. It is marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to it is between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the US. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger middle class.[20] It also had an effect on British industry at the time.


##     Industry 2.0; 
    the second industrial revolution or better known as the technological revolution is the period between 1870 and 1914. It was made possible with the extensive railroad networks and the telegraph which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas. It is also marked by ever more present electricity which allowed for factory electrification and the modern production line. It is also a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity. It, however, caused a surge in unemployment since many workers were replaced by machines in factories.[21]

##     Industry 3.0
    The third industrial revolution or Industry 3.0 occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two big wars, as a result of a slowdown with the industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. It is also called digital revolution. The global crisis in 1929 was one of the negative economic developments which had an appearance in many industrialized countries from the first two revolutions. The production of Z1 (electrically driven mechanical calculator) was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. This continued with the next significant progress in the development of communication technologies with the supercomputer. In this process, where there was extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process. Machines started to abrogate the need for human power in life.[22]

## Fourth Industrial Revolution
    4th revolution.  Digital, Physical, Biological 

    Marriage of data, analytics, and real-time presentation
    Connectivity - network effect… instant
    From data to answers (Action)
         data/connectivity
            Hack the real world

       The fourth industrial revolution is the current  and developing environment in which disruptive technologies and trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the way we live and work.

  TechSolve video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JdIZ631XjI&t

    Industry 4.0 is the subset of the fourth industrial revolution[1] that concerns industry.
        Smart Manufacturing
        In essence, industry 4.0 describes the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber-physical systems (CPS), the internet of things (IoT), industrial internet of things (IIOT), cloud computing[2][3][4][5], cognitive computing and artificial intelligence.
